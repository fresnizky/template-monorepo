# Example Web App

This is a simple example web application that demonstrates how to use shared packages within the monorepo.

## Features

- Imports components from the `@project/shared-ui` package
- Demonstrates the basic structure of an application in the monorepo

## Development

This is a minimal example application that demonstrates how applications work in the monorepo. In a real project, this would include a complete build system, TypeScript support, styling, and more functionality.

To run this application in a real setup:

```bash
# From the root of the monorepo
pnpm dev --filter @project/web
```
